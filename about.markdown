I am a software engineer in Seattle, Washington. Currently I work for Boeing Defense, Space and Security supporting [AEW&C Platforms][boeing-aew&c]. Prior to this role I spent two years with Boeing Research and Technology supporting automated wing assembly for the [777-9][boeing-777x] in Everett, WA.

I grew up in Dallas and studied mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, where I founded the ME Undergraduate Advisory Board and published research on automated measurement of drilling mud viscosity. I will complete a master's in electrical and computer engineering at The University of Washington in December 2020.
