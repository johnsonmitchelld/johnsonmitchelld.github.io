I am an engineer in Seattle, Washington. Currently I work for Boeing Research and Technology supporting automated wing assembly for the [777X][boeing-777x].

I grew up in Dallas, studied mechanical engineering at The University of Texas, and am working on a master's in electrical and computer engineering at The University of Washington.
